# My test website using wagtail

This is my first try of designing a website using wagtail.
Starting from the initial default website created by wagtail.
The commit history will record all the learning experience I had.
As I have limited knowledge of website design and python,
the choices I made may not always be the best ones.

# Some comments

1. The starting point of wagtail is more practical than django,
   it has a couple of templates and one simple home app, which
   is just what I need right now.  From what I read in the manual,
   wagtail is intend to be a CMS, the integrated apps are all
   very useful.

2. I add bootstrap4 from the start.  I'm learning that too.
   The examples from bootstrap4 omit the jquery js file kinda
   cause a lot troubles.  It took me many hours to find why
   the dropdown menu don't work.

3. Missing tables support is discouraging. I had to change
   tables into pictures to include them into my Richtext-fields.
